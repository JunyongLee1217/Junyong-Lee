[functional error]

There is a functional error in iglooscore2. In the main function, there is a statement like:

(args==null || args.length != 3)


args==null can't be hit because we can't pass null string through xml. (We should use different package for doing this.

[Bug fix]
In IglooScore1.java, I observed overallScore() has wrong logic for setting s with comparing score1 and score2. It had wrong relational operator, so I fixed it.
